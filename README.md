- List out some of the extra features  in Java 8 ?
    -  <span style ="color:white "><strong>  Lambda Expressions: Concise functional code using .
    -   <span style ="color:white "><strong>  Functional Interfaces: Single-method interfaces.
    -  <span style ="color:white "><strong> Introduced and Improved APIs:
    -  <span style ="color:white "><strong> Stream API: Efficient Data Manipulation.
    -  <span style ="color:white "><strong> Date/Time API: Robust Date and Time Handling.
    -  <span style ="color:white "><strong>  Collection API Improvements: Enhanced Methods for Collections (e.g., removeIf, replaceAll).
    -  <span style ="color:white "><strong>  Concurrency API Improvements: New classes for parallel processing (e.g., CompletableFuture).
    -   <span style ="color:white "><strong> Optional Class: Handle null values safely.
    -   <span style ="color:white "><strong> forEach() Method in Iterable Interface: Executes an action for each element in a Collection.
    -  <span style ="color:white "><strong> Default Methods: Evolve interfaces without breaking compatibility.
    -   <span style ="color:white "><strong> Static Methods: Allows adding methods with default implementations to interfaces.
    -   <span style ="color:white "><strong> Method References: Refer to methods easily. 
- explain lambda function ?
- explain functional interface ?
 - can functional interface HAVE static / default method  ?
 ( It can have any number of default, static methods but can contain only one abstract method.)
- intermediate vs terminal operation
- map vs flatMap
- predicate ,BiPredicate, function ,BiFunction, consumer, BiConsumer 
- findFirst vs findAny 
- IntStream  explain
- difference between boxed vs map ( boxed is specifically stream of primitve values to stream of their corresponding wrapper classes .)
- Explain optional  and provide some method.
- collection vs stream
- reduce()
- stream vs parallel stream
- list all built on functional interfaces
- what is metaspace > permGen vs metaspace
- can we extend the functional interfaces to another interface ?
- what is default methods in java8?
